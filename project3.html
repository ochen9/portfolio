			<h2>Context</h2>
			<p>Studysmart is a project that was designed to give UCLA students the real-time busyness levels of popular study spots on campus, as well as facilitating access to information regarding this spots such as hours and availability for room-booking in order to eliminate a few steps of finding a good spot to study, something every student needs. Studysmart is a part of UCLA DevX, a club focused on projects that will improve the college experience of UCLA students.</p>

			<h2>My Role</h2>
			<p>I took over the role of designer spring of 2018. My responsibilities primarily included completing many of the previous designer's concepts, as well as a redesign. </p>

			<h2>Initial Design</h2>

			<h2>Redesign</h2>
			<p>I redesigned the color palette in the app to have fewer colors, as well as brighter colors and more use of white. I also changed the font color and size to be more eye-catching. I also changed the design of the buttons and included them in a bottom menu bar instead.</p>
			<p>I also changed the menu to be dragged out from the side so it could include more options if necessary for the future and so the refresh button could join the rest of the buttons at the bottom. I also decided to include information about the selected study spot in a popup so that the user could view more information about it without having to go to another page. Overall, in the redesign, I attempted to make the design more streamlined and easier to use. </p>
