			<h2>Context</h2>
			<p>Studysmart is a project that was designed to give UCLA students the real-time busyness levels of popular study spots on campus, as well as facilitating access to information regarding this spots such as hours and availability for room-booking in order to eliminate a few steps of finding a good spot to study, something every student needs. Studysmart is a part of UCLA DevX, a club focused on projects that will improve the college experience of UCLA students.</p>

			<h2>My Role</h2>
			<p>I took over the role of designer spring of 2018. My responsibilities primarily included completing many of the previous designer's concepts, as well as a redesign. </p>

			<h2>Initial Design</h2>

			<h2>Redesign</h2>
			<p>I redesigned the mobile app of Studysmart to have brighter colors that attracted the eye more, as well as fewer colors in the color palette. </p>
			<p>I also included the menu to be drag out from the side so it could include more options if necessary and so the refresh button could join the rest of the buttons at the bottom. We also included information about the selected study spot in a popup so that the user could have more information about it without having to be redirected to another page. Overall, in the redesign, I attempted to make the design more streamlined and faster to use. </p>
