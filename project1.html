			<h2>Context</h2>
			<p>Mappening, a web app that aggregates events across the UCLA campus onto a single highly visual map to minimize search effort and promote discovery, allowing students to browse through events happening near or on campus and explore everything UCLA has to offer. Mappening is a part of UCLA DevX, a club focused on projects that will improve the college experience of UCLA students.</p>

			<h2>My Role</h2>
			<p>I took over the role of designer fall of 2018. I worked on designing a calendar view, a user accounts feature, and some general small additions to the app. </p>

			<h2>User Flow</h2>

			<h2>Design</h2>
			<h3>Calendar View</h3>
			<p>I designed the calendar view of the app, which includes both a month and week view, as well as the toggle between calendar and map.</p>
			<p>Mappening initially only offered a month view, but we decided to add a week view, which allowed users to view the events in more detail. Even though the filter would help sort through events and prevent too much cluttering on the calendar, the month view was still not detailed enough to provide users with the most important information they would be looking for when they used the app. </p>
			<p>Our team used a toggle button instead of just a link to switch between map view and calendar view so the app would have less text to distract the user.</p>

			<h3>User Accounts Feature</h3>
			<p>One of the features that we wanted to add to Mappening was the addition of user accounts, so that people would be able to favorite and share events with each other, which was one of the biggest reasons that they were turning away from Mappening and preferring other sources like Facebook, instead. Since this application was designed to be for UCLA students, and UCLA uses Google Accounts, we decided to have the log-in through a Google Accounts portal.</p>
			<p>Google Accounts would allow for easier integration with Google calendar, which according to polls was the most popular method of planning and scheduling used by UCLA students. The only drawback to this idea is that non-students who were interested in events happening around UCLA would not be able to have a user account.</p>

		</div>

		<div class="textcontainer">
			<h3>Organization Account</h3>
			<p>We wanted to make an option for organizations to create accounts and be able to directly add their events to Mappening, in addition to Mappening congregating the events from different sources. A big plus that Facebook events has over Mappening is the ability for clubs to create events, however, since many UCLA organizations are not associated with a specific student's Google account, we wanted to make an option to create an account that could be verified for authenticity through their student advisor. </p>

			<h2>Next Steps</h2>
			<p>Since Mappening is an effort in progress, some next steps our team is looking to make design-wise are to:</p> 
			<ul>
				<li>Improve the current mobile design of the app, as well as to design and develop an iOS/Android mobile app </li>
				<li>Complete the user accounts feature, including user/organization profiles and such</li>
				<li>Make the app more accessible to non-UCLA students as well, to expand the user demographic</li>
			</ul>
