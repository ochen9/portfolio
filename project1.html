		<h2>Context</h2>
		<p>Mappening, a web app that aggregates events across the UCLA campus onto a single highly visual map to minimize search effort and promote discovery, allowing students to browse through events happening near or on campus and explore everything UCLA has to offer. Mappening is a part of UCLA DevX, a club focused on projects that will improve the college experience of UCLA students.</p>

		<h2>My Role</h2>
		<p>I took over the role of designer fall of 2018. My responsibilities primarily included designing the calendar view, the user accounts feature, and some general small additions to the app. </p>

		<h2>User Flow</h2>

		<h2>Design</h2>
		<h3>Calendar View</h3>
		<p>I created the calendar view of the app, which includes a month and week view, as well as the toggle between calendar and map.</p>

		<h3>User Accounts Feature</h3>
		<p>One of the features that we wanted to add to Mappening was the addition of user accounts, so that people would be able to favorite and share events with each other, which was one of the biggest reasons that they were turning away from Mappening and preferring Facebook instead. Since this application was created with UCLA students in mind, and UCLA uses Google Accounts, we decided to have the log-in through a Google Accounts portal.</p>

		<p>However, a big plus that Facebook events has over Mappening is the ability for clubs to create events, however, since many UCLA organizations are not associated with a specific student's Google account, we wanted to make an option to create an account that could be verified for authenticity through their student advisor. </p>
