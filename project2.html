			<h2>Context</h2>
			<p>
			The goal of this project was to identify something about Instagram that could be better, then to design that improvement.</p>

			<h2>Research</h2>
			<p>I interviewed 4 regular Instagram users by asking the following questions:
			<ol>
				<li>How often do you use Instagram? When? Why?</li>
				<li>Can you show me what you do when you use Instagram? (e.g. catch up on the feed, post a photo, chat, or add a story)</li>
				<li>Is there anything you find confusing or dislike about the app?</li>
				<li>Is there anything you wish it allowed you to do that isnâ€™t possible yet?</li>
			</ol>
			</p>

			<p>Overall, the main takeaways from the interviews were that aside from using the app to view their feed, </p>
			<ul>
				<li>People tend to check instagram mindlessly as a way to kill time, especially the explore page</li>
				<li>For the story function, there wasn't much difference between Instagram and Snapchat, so most users tend to choose one or the other when posting stories.</li>
				<li>In addition, those who did use Instagram stories, complained that since they follow a few hundred people on Instagram, their story feed was overflooded by mere acquaintances whose stories they were not interested in viewing.</li>
				<li>Many of the newer Instagram features tended to crowd the app and confuse users, and not many of the users interviewed used the newer features, especially if their friends weren't using them.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>The Problem</h2>
			<p>After going through the interview notes, the problem I decided to solve was to organize the explore page better. People tended to use to explore page as a place to discover more content, but much of the time, ended up mindlessly scrolling through as a way to kill time. I want to make the explore page more directed towards active usage, by making it easier to view content under certain tags or categories. </p>
			
			<p>I also decided to redesign the stories page to make viewing stories easier, by changing the camera screen into a view stories page and adding a method to filter which stories were showing up in the story feed, and in what order. I also wanted to include stories of recommended pages in the explore page.</p>

			<h2>Design</h2>
			<h3>Sketches</h3>
			<p>I made a few sketches to draw out what Instagram's design was currently like and what I and the users interviewed wanted to change.</p>

			<h3>Explore Page Mockups</h3>
			<p>Then, I made a few mockups for what changes I wanted to make on the explore page.</p>
